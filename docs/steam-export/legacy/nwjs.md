# NW.js (Windows, Linux) - Legacy

NW.js was the default exporter in older versions of Construct 3 before r450. It provides full Steam Overlay support, making it useful for games that require overlay functionality.

::: info
For Construct 3 r450 and later, NW.js has been removed entirely from Construct 3. See the [this post on the Scirra forums](https://www.construct.net/en/forum/construct-3/general-discussion-7/nwjs-fully-removed-r450-186742) for more details.
