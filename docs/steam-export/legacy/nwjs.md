# NW.js (Windows, Linux) - Legacy

NW.js was the default exporter in older versions of Construct 3 before r450. It provides full Steam Overlay support, making it useful for games that require overlay functionality.

::: info
For Construct 3 r450 and later, NW.js has been removed entirely from Construct 3. See the [this post on the Scirra forums](https://www.construct.net/en/forum/construct-3/general-discussion-7/nwjs-fully-removed-r450-186742) for more details.
:::

- **Pros:**
  - ⭐ Built-in the older releases of Construct 3.
  - ⭐ Single-click exports for all OS's (Windows, Linux and macOS).
  - ⭐ Official [Greenworks](https://www.construct.net/en/construct-2/addons/83/greenworks/versions) addon supports basic Steamworks functionalities.
  - ⭐ Unofficial [Greengrinds](https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/addons/244/greengrinds/versions) addon supports advanced Steamworks functionalities.
- **Cons:**
  - ❌ Big filesize (~150MB+).
  - ❌ Deprecated - No more updates or official support.
  - ❌ Stuck on NW.js v0.100.1 / Steamworks SDK v1.62 (GreenWorks).
  - ❌ Stuck on NW.js v0.98 / Steamworks SDK 1.60 (Greengrinds).
